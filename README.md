Random stuff I create in PewPew Live. Mostly useless.

# Ray Tracing
Old test, which lights up segments, based on relative amount of traces hitting them. Works surprisingly well, but higher trace reflection amount and better relative color lighting are required for better results. Works too slow with high amount of trace reflection, as everything can be only processed on CPU. Low precision of `fx` numbers could also cause some issues.

# Field
Inefficient and a bit junky environmental lighting simulation.
